# A Lightweight Onchain CAPTCHA for the Detection of Non-Human Accounts on Ethereum (\textit{A Position Paper})

Abstract - The open and permissionless nature of blockchain allows anyone and everyone to create unlimited accounts and become a part of the ecosystem. Blockchains by default do not provide any identification and classification mechanism that can distinguish between a human vs. a non-human aka bot account. This attribute makes the Ethereum network a breeding space for activity by software robots (bots). Recently, bots have gained widespread attention for all the bad reasons such as disrupting proper airdrops, sandwich attacks, and MEV attacks. Therefore, effective identification of non-human accounts is the need of the hour for minimizing the financial losses caused by the bots.  This work is one such step in that direction. The paper proposes a Lightweight on-chain approach for detecting Non-Human Accounts on the Ethereum blockchain.
